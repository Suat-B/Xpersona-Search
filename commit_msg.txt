Add Data Intelligence branding across platform to showcase AI strategy harvest system

Implement comprehensive Data Intelligence branding that turns the invisible ai_strategy_harvest 
system into a visible trust/authority signal. Every AI-generated strategy is now positioned as 
"pure data" powering platform intelligence.

Changes:
- Add dataIntelligence messaging constants to AI_FIRST_MESSAGING
- Create /api/stats/harvest-count endpoint with 60s cache for live harvest count
- Create DataIntelligenceBadge component with compact/full variants and optional live count
- Add Data Intelligence feature card to landing page with emerald/cyan gradient accent
- Update landing hero with data-driven intelligence callout line
- Add Data Intelligence card to dashboard between strategies and API sections
- Place compact badge in DashboardChrome sidebar for persistent visibility
- Add harvest indicators to CompactAdvancedStrategyBuilder and AdvancedStrategiesSection
- Update MarqueeStrip with "Data-Driven Intelligence" and corrected trigger/action counts (35/31)
- Enhance AIFirstBanner with "AI-First, Data-Driven" positioning
- Update both marketing and dashboard footers: "Data-Driven · AI-First · Provably Fair"
- Add compact badges to GamePageClient strategy tabs (desktop + mobile)

Visual identity:
- Emerald/cyan gradient (#10b981 to #0ea5e9) distinct from amber strategy builder
- Database + sparkle hybrid SVG icon with pulse animation
- Quant-authoritative copy: "pure data", "intelligence layer", "data flows", "platform evolves"

All harvest integration points remain unchanged - this is pure front-end trust signaling that 
leverages the existing robust data capture pipeline.
